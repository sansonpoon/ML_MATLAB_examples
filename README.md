# ML_MATLAB_examples

Examples of some basic Machine Learning methods and applications, including:
- Anomaly Detection
- KMeans Clustering
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression (Decision Boundary)
- Multiclass Classification
- Principal ComponentAnalysis
- Recognize Handwritten Digits (Neural Network)
- Recommender Systems
- Regularized Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression
- SVM
- Spam Classification

All examples were written in MATLAB. Methods and data mainly follow the Machine Learning course assignments on Coursera. Codes are rewritten and organised in terms of methology and applications.
